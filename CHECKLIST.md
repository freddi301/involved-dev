# Workflow

- **trasaction script** (ref: PpEAA) in pseudo code
- **domain** (ref: DDD) plain objects and methods, encodes state
  - **entity** (ref: DDD) pair of id and state, represent mutable entities, both value objects
  - **value object** (ref: DDD) everything else
- **CQRS** (ref: MISSING)
  - **commands** (mofies state, future results of queries)
  - **queries** (does not modify state, has params and return value)
- **service** (ref: DDD) encodes actions over domain state
- **repository** (ref: PpEAA) encodes storage (ref: DDD)
- **strategy** (ref: DDD) selects different implementation for same task
- **composite** (ref: DDD) ecodes trees and graphs
- **bounded context** & **shared kernel** (ref: DDD) separate areas of project into indipendent contexts, use few data types for interfacing between them
- **SRP** (Single Responsability Principle) (ref: MISSING)
- **local interface** (ref: PpEAA) fine grained, for same thread operations
- **remote interface** (ref: PpEAA) coarse grained, for cross-thread operations
- **DTO** (Data Transfer Object) (ref: MISSING) plain object suited for serialization over wire
- **serialization** & **deserialization** (ref: MISSING) pair of function to transform DTO to wire formats
- **layer** (ref: MISSING) every layer can comunicate only with upper and lower layer
  - principal layers (ref: PpEAA)
    - presentation
    - domain
    - data source
- **encapsulation** & **information hiding** (ref: MISSING) do not reveal internal details
- **top-down** & **bottom-up** (ref: MISSING) alternate two approaches based on intuition
- **TDD** (Test Driven Development) (ref: MISSING)
  - add methods to interface -> test -> implementation
  - respect three laws of TDD
- **same level of abstraction** (ref: MISSING) in functions
- **assertion** (ref: MISSING) development time validation
- **validation** (ref: MISSING) a method that validates (ex: DTO, value object, parameters, state)
  - shape (ref: F) validates things that type system does not model (ex: string length or format, numeric range)
  - isolated (ref: F) validates if the object is valid not considering the context where it will live (ex: recipient is not same as sender)
  - contextual (ref: F) validates if the object is valid in the context (ex: deleting already deleted resource)
- **proxy** (ref: MISSING) add funcionality without altering interface (ex: add validation, remote procedure call)
- **trust boundary** (ref: F) trusted/untrusted objects or interfaces that comes from user input or remote systems must be validated before use
- **criteria** (ref: MISSING) a function that returns a boolean if a condition is satisfied
- **queue** (ref: MISSING) use for delaying actions or throughtput limit
- **party** (ref: MISSING) when partecipatns to an action can be of diverse type, create an enum (ex: { author: AuthorParty }; type AuthorParty = {type: "bot", id: string } | { type: "user", id: string })
- **memoization** (ref: MISSING) save expensive computation results
- **LSP** (Liskov Substitution Principle) (ref: MISSING) always create an interface and then the implementation (even if there will be just one)
- **data mapper** (ref: MISSING) function that maps domain object to DAO
- **DAO** (Data Access Object) (ref: MISSING) object for accessing storage
- **unit of work** (ref: PpEAA) tracks state of interaction, used resources, caches, cleans up
- **facade** (ref: MISSING) create an interface to simplify common operations over a subject
- **observer** (ref: GoF)
- **idempotent operation** (ref: MISSING)
- **optimistic lock** (ref: PpEAA)
- **reducer** & **scanner** (ref: MISSING) for state changes
- **goal oriented** (ref: F) define goals and their state, work towards
- **cursor pagination** (ref: MISSING) for remote collections
- **singleton** (ref: GoF)
- **RAII** (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) (ref: MISSING)
- **adapter** (ref: GoF)
- **template method** (ref: GoF)
- **pipes** (ref: POSA1)
- **blackboard** (ref: POSA1)
